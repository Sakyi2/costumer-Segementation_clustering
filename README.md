# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation _clustering

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **Unsupervised Machine Learning** techniques to segment customers into meaningful groups based on their demographics and purchasing behavior.  
By using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and **KMeans clustering**, we aim to uncover hidden patterns in the data that can help businesses:
- Identify customer groups
- Personalize marketing strategies
- Improve product recommendations
- Increase customer satisfaction and retention

---

## ⚙️ Techniques & Tools
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Scikit-learn** (StandardScaler, PCA, KMeans, Agglomerative Clustering)
- **Yellowbrick** (KElbowVisualizer for optimal cluster selection)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **3D visualization** with `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`

## 🔑 Key Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical features (Label Encoding)  
   - Standardize numerical features with `StandardScaler`  

2. **Dimensionality Reduction with PCA**
   - Reduced features to 2–3 principal components for visualization  
   - Retained maximum variance for interpretability  

3. **Clustering with KMeans**
   - Used **Elbow Method / KElbowVisualizer** to find optimal number of clusters  
   - Applied KMeans to segment customers  
   - Compared with Agglomerative Clustering for validation  

4. **Visualization & Insights**
   - Plotted **2D and 3D scatter plots** of clusters  
   - Summarized customer profiles per cluster (age, income, spending score, etc.)  

---

## 📊 Results & Insights
- Optimal number of clusters: **3–5** (depending on features used)  
- Clusters revealed distinct customer groups, for example:
  - **Cluster 0**: High income, high spenders (potential VIP customers)  
  - **Cluster 1**: Low income, low spenders (budget customers)  
  - **Cluster 2**: Average income, selective spenders (occasional buyers)  

These insights can help businesses **tailor promotions**, **design loyalty programs**, and **allocate marketing budgets more effectively**.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation.git
   cd customer-segmentation


   pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook notebooks/customer_segmentation.ipynb
📌 Future Work

Experiment with DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Deploy the model as a simple web dashboard (Streamlit/Flask)

Apply to real customer datasets (e-commerce, banking, retail)
